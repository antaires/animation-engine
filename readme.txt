Animation Engine

A 3D animation engine written in C++ using OpenGL for graphics, built following and adapting logic from two textbook, Game Programming in C++ by Sanjay Madhav and C++ Game Animation Programming by Gabor Szauer.

This project builds on and adapts elements from my previous openGL game engine project, simplifying some aspects by removing game specific logic while expanding the animation logic to explore more advanced techniques.
